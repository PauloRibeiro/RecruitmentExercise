# Pipefy's Development Exercise

You job in this exercise is to build a new Rails application from scratch which will connect via Pipefy's API to download, store and display a list of cards.

This app should have a single page, the root page, and it should display something similar to this:

[         IMAGEEEE          ]


As you can see in the above image, there are multiple table displaying **Cards**. Every table is grouped by it's **Pipe** name. And at the top of the page there is the name of the **Organization**.

At Pipefy, each organization can have multiple pipes. Each pipe is have its own unique configuration including **Phases** and **Fields**. Each phase inside can have different fields. Both phases and fields are fully customizable by the user.

When Pipe is all set, the user creates **Cards** which will run through the pipe's process following his rules and specifications.
